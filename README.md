- 👋 Hi, I’m @serinelar
- 📚 Library Management System
Project Overview
The Library Management System is a dual-language project built using Python and Java, aimed at simplifying the management of a library’s operations. This project showcases key programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while providing essential functionalities for both users and administrators. It is designed to help track books, manage members, and handle borrowing and returning actions efficiently.

This system is perfect for small libraries, showcasing a robust command-line interface for learning and practical purposes.

Core Features
🏷️ Add New Books: Administrators can easily add books to the library’s catalog, complete with titles and author information.
👥 Register Members: Keep track of library members, allowing them to borrow and return books.
📖 Borrow and Return: Members can borrow up to 3 books at a time and return them when they’re done reading.
🔍 Book Search: Search for books by their title, making it easy to locate them in the system.
Why This Project?
This project is a demonstration of how to apply OOP principles in two widely-used programming languages, Python and Java. I built this as a practical, hands-on way to deepen my understanding of software design patterns, file handling, and user interactions in different environments.

Technologies Used
Languages: Python, Java
Development Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Getting Started
Python Setup:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System/python
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Java Setup:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System/java
Compile and execute:
bash
Copy code
javac Main.java
java Main
How to Use It
Once the system is running, here’s what you can do:

Add books: Administrators can register new books with attributes like title, author, and ISBN.
Register members: Easily manage library members who can borrow and return books.
Borrow/Return books: Members can check out and return books within the system’s borrowing limits.
Here’s a quick example of how it works in Python:

python
Copy code
# Add a new book
new_book = Book("1984", "George Orwell", "ISBN001")
library.add_book(new_book)

# Register a new member
new_member = Member("John Doe", "M101")
library.register_member(new_member)

# Borrow a book
new_member.borrow_book(new_book)

# Return a book
new_member.return_book(new_book)
Future Improvements
Some additional features I'd like to implement in future versions include:

📅 Book Due Dates: Add functionality to track the due date of borrowed books.
📊 Analytics Dashboard: Display data on popular books, most active members, etc.
📚 Book Recommendations: Suggest books to members based on their borrowing history.
